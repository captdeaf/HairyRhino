What's left TODO:

* Per-site logging, rather than all dumped onto log.out.

* Fix file uploads. Right now there's an issue with encoding.

* Make Date+Time easy.

* Timer / cron jobs.

* Add a standard scope library that is created, then cloned.
  - Add pg.loadExternalFile for extras and stdlib loading.
  - defClass
  - jsmark/jsload (With automatic jsreloading).
  - utils.js
  - json.js
  - Ajax-y extras. (AJAJ-y?)

* Figure out how to use Java to speed up the Web.mount'd static file access?

Later:
* Rewrite main handler in java for speed?

* HTTPS support?
