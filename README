Hairy Rhino is a combination of the 'javascript server' (jsserver) and the
individual sites.

jsserver/ contains Hairy Rhino. You'll need to copy config_js.sample to
          config.js and edit. (A handy default config.js already exists)

sites/ contain all the separate sites, each in their own directories.
       jsserver loads each directory within as a separate site.
